#### Resources
* [HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Google Engineers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4LtxgXdHWjSZkpDbDhsckZOMDA/view)
  * These are slides from a 4-hour course Victoria used to teach to Google engineers on how to use HTML, CSS, and JS.
  * Detailed information about layout and positioning here! (floats, etc)
  * Read HTML and CSS, but **skip JavaScript** (requires advanced programming knowledge)
* [University of Washington CSE 154: Web Programming](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/lectures.shtml#today)
  * The first 5 lectures discuss HTML and CSS in detail
  * JavaScript is also discussed later in the course (though using raw JavaScript, no jQuery)

#### Labs
* [Journal Lab](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/labs/lab2-journal.shtml)
  * Follow the instructions and ignore the bits that would only be relevant to UW students, i.e. checking in with a TA, uploading to "Webster"
